This is the unofficial repo for a class project/website created and maintained by the class members of Grow With Google and Udacity 2018.  The boiler plate code has been added.  Feel free to make pull requests at will. Happy coding!


To contribute, simply make a pull request or fork this repo and work on it that way.  Alternatively, you can pull files to your local environment (your computer) and work on them that way.

The Resources Page now has a basic html structure. It is ready for contributions from the community. Feel free to add links to your favorite resources and a small description if you would like to. 

Subheadings need to be `<h2>` and have the class "subheading". Every subheading needs to have an `<ol>` with `<li>` items so we can keep it looking organized and numbered.

Make sure your links look like this `<a href = "https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a>` so that they open on a new page. 

Of course this is all subject to change based on what the community wants to do with the pages. Just getting us started for now.

We are staring to get into the nitty gritty for the site and we need to make some decisions on how to build it. 

1) The framework is going to be Bootstrap v4. I know not everyone has experience with this, but for those that do it will probably make creating the pages much easier. So we are going with that and hoping our more experienced people can help guide us. 

2) Unless I hear any objections we are going to go with a color scheme of mainly white and blue. The color scheme used on the Udacity website. We are hoping to achive a smiliar style to that website for continuity. 

3) I'm hoping a mockup comes soon. Will keep you posted.
