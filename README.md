# Udacity-Yearbook-Project
Optional Yearbook Collaboration for Udacity Front-End Scholarship Participants

<p><strong>Question: What is this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> We aren't 100% sure yet.  What we do know is that we wanted to collaborate on a project together.  If that mean's we end up creating a website with a collage of all the projects that's awesome.  If we end up creating an amalgamation of HTML/CSS/JS and want to show it off, that's great also!</p>  

<p><strong>Question: Can I contribute?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Of course you can!  No matter what your experience/knowledge level is we encourage everyone to contribute.</p>

<p><strong>Question: Where do I begin?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Start off by forking this repo and making changes.  Do whatever it is you want...build upon the boiler plate code, or throw in some JS and link them up to the index...the point is this is about learning, growing, and getting experience as a team :)  Feel free to make edits/contributions to anything!</p>

This is the unofficial repo for a class project/website created and maintained by the class members of Grow With Google and Udacity 2018.  The boiler plate code has been added.  Feel free to make pull requests at will. Happy coding!

The Resources Page now has a basic html structure. It is ready for contributions from the community. Feel free to add links to your favorite resources and a small description if you would like to. 

Subheadings need to be `<h2>` and have the class "subheading". Every subheading needs to have an `<ol>` with `<li>` items so we can keep it looking organized and numbered.

Make sure your links look like this `<a href = "https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a>` so that they open on a new page. 

Of course this is all subject to change based on what the community wants to do with the pages. Just getting us started for now.
